trutek-tri-drawer-panel
=======================

Custom components for Polymer Project (polymer-project.org).  This modifies the existing core drawer panel to have a middle responsive step.

To view this component in action you can go <a href="http://www.trutekinnovations.com">here</a>.  Which is a working example that combines the drawer with my header wrapper to give you a general site layout. 

You can also view the demo directly by going <a href="http://www.trutekinnovations.com/bower_components/trutek-tri-drawer-panel/demo.html">here</a>.

This project can also be installed using bower just like polymer.  It should download all needed files.
bower install tikicoder/trutek-tri-drawer-panel
